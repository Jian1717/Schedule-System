Title: Inventory Management Application

Purpose: This application helps manage inventory for a retail store by allowing users to add, edit, and delete products and categories.
The purpose of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing a small business. The application allows the user to add and remove customers, track inventory, and manage orders. By using a graphical user interface (GUI), the user can easily navigate through the different functionalities of the application, which saves time and reduces the chances of errors compared to using a command-line interface. Additionally, the application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve data, ensuring that the data is easily accessible and secure. This application is designed to be used by small business owners who want a simple and efficient way to manage their daily operations.
